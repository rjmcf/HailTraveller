You must go back to each planet and from each place you must recover a piece of the Ultimate Weapon. Only once you have each piece should you come back to me. But once you have it, do not delay. Time is not on our side!",
	"You have not yet found all the pieces of the Ultimate Weapon! Go back and search for more!",
	"You have succeeded in your task! I will go ahead to prepare the Citadel for your arrival. Talk to me again at its doors!",

	{"Yes" : "Thank you for trying to find the deepest heat of the volcano, you will be helping us by doing so!", "No" : "That is a pity. The forges will just have to stay cold until I find some other helper. Talk to me again when you are ready to have our piece of the Ultimate Weapon."},
