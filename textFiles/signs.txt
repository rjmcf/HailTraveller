all_signs = [{"first_sign" : '''\"Hail Traveller! \n\nWhat you see before you is the mighty citadel, wherein dwell those who rule over the collective. This planet is solely for the purpose of supporting the citadel, and the homes of those who work in it. The four planets that make up the collective all reside around the same star as this does. Each planet is sparsely populated, as the people require but a small amount of space for their population. Each planet is rich in resources, both that the people use in earnest, and those that they allow to lie untapped. Explore and discover! We will find rich pickings here!"''', "citadel_sign": '''"We have failed. Before we can progress, we must understand further.\"'''},
{"first_sign": '''\"Cracked. Shattered. Betrayed. Such treachery will not go unpunished. We will have revenge. We will have justice!\"''', "second_sign" : '''\"The people of Paxak are not trusting. The people of Paxak never trusted The Messenger. The coming of the stranger was a bad omen. If the Collective had asked... as if they would. Who comes shouting about how rich and powerful they are and then says they'll share that with us? A liar.\"''', "third_sign": '''\"When we settled, in the origin days, we were promised justice for the good and justice for the bad. We would be left alone to our work and life as long as we followed their rules. They broke their own rules when they did not consult us about The Messenger. The threat was against us all, and they made their own decision. Had we not watched the skies, it would have cost us our lives, not just theirs. We don't often run. We're running now.\"''', "fourth_sign": '''\"The Messenger was not of the Collective. It was other, foreign, parasitic. It infected the Citadel with its promises of protection. The Messenger's own planet had been destroyed by an army from the stars. Its own people were made to flee by the fires of war. The Messenger was the scout sent to represent its people, the advance party, sent to warn us of the war that would surely reach us too. The Messenger offered protection. The army it brought was large. So then, what could we offer it in return? The Messenger knew about the Ultimate Weapon. The whole of Paxak flames when we think of who told it, who gave away the secret of our power. We may never know. But we watched the skies, and we waited for the mistake of The Messenger that would prove us right.\"''', "fifth_sign": '''\"Our technology saved may lives that day. We saw The Messenger's army. We saw how the weapons were armed and targeted on the Citadel. They didn't believe us at first. They caught The Messenger halfway to its ship. The coward cracked. That was the only time it allowed its stinking self to be seen by any other than the Collector. It was our attack that destroyed the Citadel, that killed the fools for not listening, that killed The Messenger. We can only hope that his "protection" never got a proper lock on our position. There is nowhere to run.\"'''}]
