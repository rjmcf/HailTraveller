help_text = "Welcome to 'Hail Traveller'! \n\nThis game is in the style of a text-based adventure game. This means that you type commands in the box below in response to what is written in this box. Commands typically are made of a verb, for example 'move', 'go', 'walk', 'talk', 'look' etc, and a noun that the verb is done to, for example 'houses' or 'sign'. Some verbs will have the same effect, for example 'move', 'go' and 'walk' and some others will all change your position. \n\nAs is demonstrated above, verbs written in this box will be coloured green and nouns that you can interact with in this location will be coloured red. Thus you can interact with 'houses' but not with a 'building'. \n\nWhenever you reach a new place, a good first step is to use the 'look' command, with no noun. This will tell you what is in your vicinity and what you can interact with, perhaps by using the 'look at (noun)' command. It will also show you what is in each direction that you can move in, typically 'left', 'right' or 'forwards'. Whenever these directions are not enough, the verb that you should use, perhaps 'enter', will be indicated in the description of the item. \n\nGood luck!"
