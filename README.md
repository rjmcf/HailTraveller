# HailTraveller
A text-based exploration-adventure game. When you wake up with no memory in an abandoned settlement, it's up to you to piece together its history, and to find your place in it.

With Python 3 and Tkinter installed, playing should be as simple as navigating to the directory in your terminal and typing `make play`.

Note that this version is far from finished. About three quarters of the locations are missing and a lot of polish is required to really sell the late game. However, you can play the game from start to finish, and I'm proud of that. This has been an exercise in game development, and an opportunity to tell a story that has been waiting in my head since 2014.
